# ted
TED is The Eighth Day project. The Bible speaks of how God, the Author of the Universe, worked for six days and on the seventh he rested. But on the eighth, already with a substantial retirement fund set aside and for reasons unbeknownst to me, he decided to work again. And so, too, then must this humble author.

# purpose
The purpose of this project is to hone my software development skills by creating an app to help local church communities connect with the Planning Center API and their own respective database content.
