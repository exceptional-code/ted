TED is The Eighth Day project. The Bible speaks of how God, the Author of the Universe, worked for six days and on the seventh he rested. But on the eighth, already with a substantial retirement fund set aside and for reasons unbeknownst to me, he decided to work again. And so, too, then must this humble author.

## purpose
The purpose of this project is to hone my software development skills by creating a progressive web app to help local church communities connect with the Planning Center API and their own respective database content.

## design
- Front end to render visuals to authenticated clients and communicate with proxy server.
- Single authorization of proxy server to create and manage a connection pool.
- Aggregate requests to avoid exceeding rate limits of third party API.
- Renew proxy server authorization periodically with refresh tokens.
- Authenticate individual clients with password and user name authentication.
- Maintain client access across sessions with locally-stored tokens.
